**{% date page.date %}** - *Eternal's* [recent patch][] added 42 cards to the *Eternal* Draft Packs (making them legal in Expedition), and adjusted the weightings of many more. Changes like this can happen a few times between large expansion set releases, and this is the first for the *Argent Depths* format.

According to the patch's notes, these changes were made <q cite="https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/8-10-balance-changes-and-draft-expedition-update/">with a look towards improving faction balance in draft, and increasing support for the five Vow-combinations in Expedition</q>.

Here are this update's changes, sorted into **Added** for additions to the Draft Packs and Expedition, and **Kept** for adjusted weightings *(weighting affects the rate a card appears in draft&mdash;cards with a weight of 5x are five times more likely to appear in Draft Packs than cards with a weight of 1x at the same rarity)*. The official list of current Draft Pack contents and Expedition-legal cards can always be found [on DWD's site][Card List].
