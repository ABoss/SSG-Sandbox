**{% date page.date %}** - With each large expansion, Dire Wolf Digital redesigns the *Eternal* Draft Packs and Expedition to complement the new set. Draft and Expedition are [now entirely new formats][EoG updates]{target="_blank} with [*Empire of Glass'*][EoG]{target="_blank} release, so let's explore the changes.

 [EoG updates]: https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/argent-depths-format-updates/

The official list of current Draft Pack contents and Expedition-legal cards can always be found [on DWD's site][Card List]{target="_blank}. Our trusty Grenadin have processed that info, compared it to the previous formats, and compiled the changes into this handy interactive gallery for you.

Use the toggles below to swap between format views, and to filter cards based on their factions, draft weightings, or changes. A few notes:

* The Draft Packs toggle only shows the Draft Pack changes (not *Empire of Glass*) between this new format and the *Argent Depths* format's [November 2020 update][] (we are ignoring the special *Empire of Glass* Draft Preview).
* The Draft Packs toggle displays the cards' weightings *(weighting affects the rate a card appears in draft&mdash;for example, cards with a weight of 5x are five times more likely to appear in Draft Packs than cards with a weight of 1x at the same rarity)*.
    * With the Draft Pack toggle on, additional toggles are shown for each weighting, and for weighting changes to cards kept in the draft pack.
* The Expedition changes **do not** include the following sets, which remain in the format in their entirety:
    * *Argent Depths*, including its promos (from Coslo, Friendly Scavenger onward)
    * *Awakening*
    * *Bastion Rising*
    * *Empire of Glass*
* The Expedition changes **do** include pre-*Argent Depths* promos, *Echoes of Eternity*, Draft Pack updates, and cards from older campaign and bundle sets.
