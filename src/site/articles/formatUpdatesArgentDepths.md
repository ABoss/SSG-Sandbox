**{{- articleDate -}}** - With each large expansion, Dire Wolf Digital redesigns the *Eternal* Draft Packs and Expedition to complement the new set. They were updated on June 24 with [*Argent Depths'* release](https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/argent-depths-format-updates/), so let's explore the changes to the Draft and Expedition formats.

The official list of current Draft Pack contents and Expedition-legal cards can always be found [on DWD's site](https://direwolfdigital.com/news/draft-packs-card-list/). We sorted each card into **Kept**, **Added**, or **Removed** for each format. Use the toggles below to swap between formats, and to filter cards based on their faction or change.

A few notes:

* Draft only shows the Draft Pack changes (not *Argent Depths*) between this redesign and the *Echoes of Eternity* format's May 12 update (we are ignoring the special *Argent Depths* Draft Preview).
* Draft displays the cards' weightings&mdash;cards with a weight of 5 are five times more likely to appear in Draft Packs than cards with a weight of 1 at the same rarity.
* The Expedition changes **do not** include the following sets, which remain in the format in their entirety:
    * *Argent Depths*
    * *Shadow of the Spire*
    * *Whispers of the Throne*
    * *Echoes of Eternity*, including its promos (from Traver's Farm onward)
* The Expedition changes **do** include pre-*Echoes* promos, *The Flame of Xulta*, Draft Pack updates, and removed cards from older campaign and bundle sets.
