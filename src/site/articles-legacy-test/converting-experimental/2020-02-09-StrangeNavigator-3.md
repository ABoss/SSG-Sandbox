**{% date page.date %}** -  Thanks to [Jedi_EJ on Twitch][] for helping us to reveal this spoiler from **Echoes of Eternity** on his stream today. And to those in chat who played along by generating some insightful guesses based on the [theme deck][] presented earlier.

**Strange Navigator - 2{% icon 'Time' %}{% icon 'Shadow' %}**  
3/2 Explorer Stranger - Rare  
When a player plays a Stranger, each unit in their void gets +1/+1.  
Pay 9 and exhaust Strange Navigator to draw five units from your void.  

## First impressions

* For starters, a 3/2 body for 2{% icon 'Time' %}{% icon 'Shadow' %} passes the Vanilla Test and provides a very  respectable early attacker or defender.
* Void love in the faction that is likey in the best position to take advantage of it.
* An immediate +1/+1 to your **Void** that generates future value from syergistic cards such as **Shadowlands Guide**, **Memory Dredger** or **Eremot's Machinations.** 
* Though expensive, drawing five Units for **9 Power** is one of the best rates in the game - especially given the buff that they receive.
* **Echoes of Eternity** appears to be bucking the previous trend by introducing a number of **Strangers** with abilities that are generally relevant to their respective factions, making them viable in a variety of lists beyond just dedicated **Strangers** decks.
* A higher frequency of **Strangers** in the Meta will make for  some interesting gameplay decisions, considering that their valuable abilities are almost always symmetrical if your opponent also controls a **Stranger**.
